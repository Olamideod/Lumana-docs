# Trespassing

Trespassing detection flags any object that enters the monitored camera view, with no minimum time requirement. Unlike zone protection, which waits for a dwell threshold before triggering, this alert triggers the moment an object appears.

## How it works

Lumana detects when a person, vehicle, or other object enters the full camera view. The alert triggers immediately.

**Trespassing zones** work the same way but apply to a specific drawn zone within the camera frame rather than the full view.

## Configure the alert

1. Select the **bell icon** in the navigation bar. The Alerts monitoring view opens.

3. Select **Security** in the left sidebar to go to that section, then select **Use template** on the **Trespassing** card. The Create trespassing page opens.

4. Enter a name in the **Alert name** field, for example "After-hours server room" or "Restricted perimeter entry."
5. Select the **objects** field in the alert rule sentence. A dropdown opens with the available object types.

Select one or more object types to monitor:

* **people**: Detects people.
* **vehicles**: Detects vehicles.
* **animals**: Detects animals.

Any custom objects you've already created appear below the built-in types, tagged as **Custom**. You can select multiple types. If you need to detect a specific object that isn't in the list, then select **+ New custom object**. Follow the steps in [Create a custom object](proximity.md#create-a-custom-object) to complete setup.

6. Select the **camera** field to open the Choose cameras modal. Select the cameras you want to monitor, then select **Select** to confirm.

7. Select the **time** field to set when the alert is active. [Configure alerts](../../configure-alerts.md#schedule) covers the schedule options.
8. Optionally, select **default configuration** to adjust display settings, confidence level, priority, blocking period, and alert message. [Configure alerts](../../configure-alerts.md#default-configuration) covers these settings.
9. Select **Then** <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/alert-then.png" alt="" height="18"> to choose the action Lumana takes when the alert triggers. The available actions are covered in [Alert actions](../../alert-actions.md).
10. Select **Create alert** in the top right corner. The alert is saved and becomes active immediately.
